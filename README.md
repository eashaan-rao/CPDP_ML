# 🤖 Exploring the Effectiveness of Defect Prediction Models in ML-Based Software Projects

✅ **Status:** Research Study on Defect Prediction (DP) Models for Machine Learning (ML) Software  
📚 **Focus Area:** Improving defect prediction accuracy in Python-based ML projects.

---

### 📄 **Abstract**
As the software landscape transforms with the growing adoption of **Machine Learning (ML)-based software**, identifying and resolving defects early in the development lifecycle becomes **critical for ensuring software quality.**  

💡 **Problem Statement:**  
- While numerous **Defect Prediction (DP) models** exist for traditional software, they are not optimized for the unique characteristics of ML-based code.
- Existing DP models often fail to distinguish between ML and non-ML components, reducing their effectiveness in identifying defects specific to ML code.

---

### 🔍 **Our Study**
We address this gap by conducting a **comprehensive analysis** of Python-based ML projects, exploring the effectiveness of DP models across various dimensions.

### 📊 **Key Highlights**
- ✅ **8 Within-Project Defect Prediction (WPDP)** techniques evaluated.
- 🔁 **56 Cross-Project Defect Prediction (CPDP)** techniques analyzed.
- 🤖 **8 Classifiers and 7 Transfer Learning Techniques** used for evaluation.
- ⚠️ **Challenge Identified:** High variability and overfitting in models due to insufficient feature engineering for ML-based code.
- 📏 **Metric Gap:** Current DP metrics are predominantly designed for object-oriented languages, making them less effective for ML codebases.
